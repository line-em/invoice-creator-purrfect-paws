# Invoice Creator: Purrfect Paws

Solo project made at the Scrimba Javascript Course. ðŸŽ‰
It is coded with vanilla JS and is fully responsive (I hope!). It is themed after a made-up **veterinary clinic**, Purrfect Paws. All the prices are arbitrary.

If you encounter any problems, or have any feedback for me, I'd love to hear about it! Thank you! ðŸ˜Š

**This project is finally complete!**

The most challenging aspect of this project so far was including the **remove buttons** and making it properly functional in manipulating the array. I'm happy to say that it is now working as intended! ðŸ¥³âœ¨

Of course, if you do find any bugs, errors, or any suggestions at all, please let me know! I'd love to hear from you! ðŸ˜Š
