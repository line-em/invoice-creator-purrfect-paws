# Invoice Creator: Purrfect Paws

Solo project made at the Scrimba Javascript Course. ðŸŽ‰
It is coded with vanilla JS and is fully responsive (I hope!). It is themed after a made-up **veterinary clinic**, Purrfect Paws. All the prices are arbitrary.

If you encounter any problems, or have any feedback for me, I'd love to hear about it! Thank you! ðŸ˜Š

**This project is still incomplete.**

The most challenging aspect of this project so far is including the **remove buttons**, after the items have been added to the Invoice. I'm studying a solution, however, it will take a little time.

## To-Do

- [ ] Include a functional Remove button
- [ ] Generate a some feedback after clicling on Send Invoice.

## Changelog

- 1.0 - Initial commit.
